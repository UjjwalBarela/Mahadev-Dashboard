# 🛍️ Mahadev E-Commerce Store Analysis

## 📄 Description & Purpose

The **Mahadev E-Commerce Store Analysis** project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard built to provide strategic insights into the performance of a fictional e-commerce business. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how business intelligence tools, like Power BI, can help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by visualizing critical performance metrics.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains transactional and customer-level information, split into two tables: `Orders` and `Details`. Using these datasets, the report consolidates and analyzes various business dimensions such as profit trends, customer spending habits, product category performance, and regional revenue contribution.

The dashboard features KPIs and charts that are intuitive, interactive, and responsive. The top KPIs include **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, **Total Quantity Sold**, and **Average Order Value (AOV)**. These are key indicators of business performance, offering a high-level overview at a glance.

In-depth analyses are carried out using various types of visuals:
- **Profit Trends by Month** helps identify seasonality and monthly fluctuations.
- **Category-wise Quantity Sold** and **Sub-Category Profit** visuals assist in inventory and product planning.
- **Customer-level Sales** and **Payment Mode Preferences** shed light on consumer behavior.
- **Geographic Revenue Distribution** offers insights into market penetration across Indian states.
- **Quarter-wise and State-wise filters** enhance interactivity, allowing users to drill down into specific segments.

This project also emphasizes the use of **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to calculate custom KPIs, perform time intelligence, and create dynamic metrics across multiple dimensions. The slicers and filters allow for an exploratory data analysis experience, enabling users to gain insights tailored to their needs.

The dashboard caters to business users, analysts, and stakeholders looking for an intuitive way to monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-informed strategic decisions.

## 🗃️ Data Source

The dataset used for this project is titled **“Mahadev E-Commerce Store”** and is available on Kaggle. It simulates a realistic e-commerce environment with two main tables:

1. **Orders Table** – Contains order-level data such as order IDs, customer names, product categories, sub-categories, and geographic information like city and state.
2. **Details Table** – Includes granular details like profit, quantity, amount, and payment mode associated with each order.

This dataset provides a solid foundation for creating practical business intelligence solutions, mimicking what a retail or e-commerce analyst might work with in a real business scenario. It enables deep-dives into performance across time, geography, product lines, and customer segments.

The dataset’s structure and diversity support a variety of DAX calculations and visual storytelling techniques in Power BI. With its rich attributes, it is ideal for demonstrating sales analysis, profit breakdown, customer segmentation, and inventory decisions, making it an excellent educational resource for analysts and dashboard developers.
